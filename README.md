# HospitalDatabase
A project that utilizes MySQL and PHP in order to allow the end-user to insert patient data into a hospital database.  MySQL and PHP is used for the back-end functionality while HTML and CSS is used for the front-end.

This project was based off of a group project in CSc 174 in California State University, Sacramento.  I worked with two other students in order to complete this project.
